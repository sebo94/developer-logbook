# Lissajous curves

Also known as Bowditch curves, they are the visual representation of complex harmonic motion


A Lissajous curves is the graph of a system of parametric equations

> x = A sin ⁡ ( a t + δ ) , y = B sin 

The visual form of these curves is often suggestive of a three-dimensional knot, and indeed many kinds of knots, including those known as Lissajous knots, project to the plane as Lissajous figures.
