## Done

1. Finished the hover effect for the instagram posts  
2. Managed to retrieve medias from instagram and display them in the hover component
3. Implemented a check for the access token validity and automatically refreshing it if it's about to expire (deciding to hard code the token since the basic display api is read only and for my understanding there should not be any troubles with this)
4. Added back to top button and redirecting to home when clicking on the logo
5. Learned about typescript, it's main types, how it works, and how to use it/add it to our projects
6. Looked into the pros and cons of client side rendering vs server side
