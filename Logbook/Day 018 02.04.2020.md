## Done

Finished the B&B website. I'm not spending more time trying to make it responsive, starting a new project and making the right decisions (and understand why) in the beginning will save me a lot of time and make me get a better grasp on things.

### Vw, vh, vmim, vmax and responsive design
. Be aware when setting vh for mobiles: when the content is bigger it's going to overflow your container and look terrible, use media queries to fix that.
. Yuo can use fixed font size for big and small screens and vw for the middle sizes to create nice responsive titles (does not work very well for paragraph text).
. Another possible use is setting a minimum font size for smaller screens and then use vh to make it responsive(paragraph text)
. Simply not the best use for font size, might want to use it for setting elements size.


1. Made about & contact (B&B website)
2. Learned a cool way to make test readable over an image using background colors and multiply blend mode
3. Did a small project showcasing nice hover effects
4. Looked into stacking context and which elements create a new one (can always google the full list)
