## Done

1. Made some fine adjustments on the goddess portfolio ui
2. Decided the "last" changes that need to be made to the project
3. Made a recap of where we're at and where we need to go (next projects to work on)
4. Went over the HTML forms section of the w3schools website to keep fresh (i wanna tackle all the sections of the website as i progress with my path as a developer just for pure satisfaction)
