## Done

1. Made a bunch of edabit challanges (starting with the easy ones and then scale up)
2. Resumed the amazon scraper project, need to fix some bugs when scraping, the actual HTML pages changed since last update
3. Made some more decisions about how the scraper should look like and its functionalities (might wanna implement a readme file or something to keep track of this)
4. Starting researching about how to get data from the web and turn them into meaninful keywords using machine learning (it is a very broad topic and i am very now to machine learning so there is quite some stuff to learn about)
