## Done

Pretty much continued the React course by Academind on Udemy pt.2 (covered a lottt of advanced features)

### !!! Debugged the error that made me go crazy for 2 days !!!
I was wondering why my components would render twice and found out the App component was a functional component and was wrapped into a React.StrictMode component.
By googleing i found out that it's an intentional feature and only happens in development, and helps find accidental side effects put into the render phase.
Might not be the deepest answer but stil it got me unstuck: removing the StrictMode component avoids double rendering.

1. Covered stateful components and their lifecycle methods, when and how to use them
2. Stateful component creation and update lifecycles
3. Learned about the same methods for functional components, creation cleanup and update (React.memo)
4. Rendering adjcent components using Fragment
5. Looked at pure components, higher order functions, proptypes, refs
6. Dealing with prop chain issues using context API
7. Made 1/5 of FCC Front-end librariesproject: Random Quote Machine (didn't go too deep into giving it my own style, just wanted to get it done and become more confident using React; might go deeper in the next projects so i can practice the different styling methods showcased in the course)
