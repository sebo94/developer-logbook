## Done

Pretty much continued the React course by Academind on Udemy pt.2

1. Covered stateful components and their lifecycle methods, when and how to use them
2. Stateful component creation and update lifecycles
3. Learned about the same methods for functional components, creation cleanup and update (React.memo)
