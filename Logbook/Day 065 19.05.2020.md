## Done

1. Finished hover effects on grid
2. Polished the lazy loading for every component (still using the track visibility component, might wanna consider different ways to achieve later)
3. Implemented opacity animation on scroll (and then removed it because it did not make any sense with the rest of the website)
4. Made the navbar animate after scrolling past the hero section
5. Implemented mobile navigation menu
6. Made a spinner component for loading states 
7. Watched a video on three different program paradigms (oop, functional, declerative) and their characteristics
