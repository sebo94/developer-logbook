##Done

Continued my journey into advanced CSS concepts.
I decided to work on one real project every day starting with front-end; i'm then going to transition into different/more complicated projects (js functionality, react, backend,etc).
The idea here is to write as much code as i can to consolide my knowledge while i still explore new concepts and technologies.

1. SVG: Why, What & How (superlight weight, no http request if you put it inline)
2. SVG: differences between viewbox & viewport
3. Made a small project showcasing how to clip an image to text
4. Made a memorial website layout referencing this (https://freewebsitetemplates.com/preview/template3/index.html)
