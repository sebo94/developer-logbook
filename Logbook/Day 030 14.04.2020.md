## Done

Still have to fix some bugs with the pomodoro clock but i have a basic version running

1. Finished 5/5 of FCC Front-end libraries projects: Pomodoro Clock
2. Learned how to implement a simple timer in vanilla js 
3. Discovered how to execute functions when setState finishes
4. Learned how to navigate programmatically with react-router (useful when you want to navigate after something else happens)
5. Looked into nested routes, lazy loading and Suspense
