## Done

1. Used react parallax in the home component
2. Added dynamic motion to the parallax
3. Looked into different ways to optimize the parallax movement since it's pretty resource-consuming; also found out smooth scrolling is not enabled by default in chrome (need to find a way to deal with this)
4. Looked into libraries for on scroll animations (need to try sal.js out, compare it with the current aos library in term of funcionalities and size and choose)
5. Made the navbar change dinamically when various sections are visible
6. Navbar now disappears after scrolling down then page and the reappers after a few scrolls (want to animate this and rmake this process smooht; also want to look into more transitions to increase user experience)
