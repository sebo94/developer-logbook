## Done

Learned about some advanced CSS concepts.
It's recommended to specify durations using "ms" so our js code will eventually
understand it.
Tip: try to limit your animations to opacity, transform, scale since they use GPU resources,
while other properties animations use CPU and this could lead to performance issues
(if there is no GPU acceleration).
Extra Tip: specify the property to animate instead of using "all" to boost perfomance.
