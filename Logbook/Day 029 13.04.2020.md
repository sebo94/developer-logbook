## Done

I mainly focused on finishing the react calculator, i had a bug occuring somewhere and started over from scratch.
The basic functionalities are done but i haven't fully tested it and the code is one of the ugliest things i have ever looked at: for now i just want to get the projects done and i will fix and optimize them by the end of the week.

1. Finished 4/5 of FCC Front-end libraries projects: Javascript calculator
2. Reviewed my regex knowledge to discover i need to get to know them better
