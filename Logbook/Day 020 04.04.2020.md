## Done

Pretty much continued the React course by Academind on Udemy

When you set width in %, try setting min-width and max-width in px

1. Made some research about how to avoid content from resizing and layout from changing (which seems to be my main problem with CSS right now)
2. Reviewed working with lists and conditional rendering in React (successfully passed second assignment)
3. Went into the different ways of styling elements and useful libraries for that purpose (Radium, Styled Components, Modules)
4. Learned a new way to debug React code using Sourcemaps & React Devtools (which i had previously installed but never actually used)
5. Had a look at refactoring React code and better project structure
6. Finally got into the React internals section, started to learn more about components and their lifecycle
