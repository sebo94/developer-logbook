In the next weeks i'm focusing on front-end: improving my CSS skills and learning more about UI design. 

##Done

1. Finished w3s advanced css tutorial 
2. Scored 98% on the css quiz (the question was about css not allowing negative padding while it does, it just wont do anything)
3. Started working on the Blooger website (a link to codepen will be provided at the end of the project)
