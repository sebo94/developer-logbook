## Done

Definetly want to look into responsive design and tweak the B&B website some more, practice more to really understand what units to use and when (especially why).
Right now the website layout goes all over the place when resizing the page.

1. Finished the main page markup and functionality (B&B website)
2. Learn how to get gmaps positions using their js API (even though i didn't manage to make it work on my website for some weird reason)
3. Started implementing media queries (B&B website)
4. Attempted an infinite loop carousel (it works but it goes back to the first slide instead of scrolling trough infinite slides)
5. Did rooms.html & activities.html (B&B website)
