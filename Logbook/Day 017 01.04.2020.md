##Done

1. Finished the main page markup and functionality (B&B website)
2. Learn how to get gmaps positions using their js API (even though i didn't manage to make it work on my website for some weird reason)
3. Started implementing media queries (B&B website)
4. Attempted an infinite loop carousel (it works but it goes back to the first slide instead of scrolling trough infinite slides type of thing)
