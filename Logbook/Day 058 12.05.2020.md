## Done

1. Implemented a test masonry version with filtering by category (probably need to implement the imagesLoaded method for working with images)
2. Improved performance on the keiko corp test website provided as an exercise of the junior to senior course (mainly image optimizations and critical render path: one important takeaway is think twice before using libraries and such and look for the best ways to render them)
3. Looked at the differences between other js frameworks and how and when they might be useful
4. Learned about what's going on under the hood with webpack and some valid alternatives to it
