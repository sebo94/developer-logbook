## Done

1. Continued my streak of very easy js exercises on edabit
2. Looked for cool features and design to implement in my portfolio
3. Create the portfolio project (for now just using react for the front-end) and started working on the first components (3d image split)
4. Started learning about p5.js (just the basics)
5. Made a project implementing Lissajous curves with p5.js (need to make a whole little project around it)
6. Started looking into canvas animations and some libraries that may be useful
