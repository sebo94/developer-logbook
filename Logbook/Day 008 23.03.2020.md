##Done

The website was designed using the 'Mobile First' approach.
It means it was first designed for smaller screens and then adapted to larger ones.

1. Finished the Photography website
2. Used jQuery to animate position
3. Added media queries for screens over 500 & 700 px wide
4. Started working on the blur landing page project
