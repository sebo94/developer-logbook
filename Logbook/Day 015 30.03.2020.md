Definetly want to dig deeper into CSS Grid, opens up lots of interesting possibilities for responsive design.
Grid minimax() only accepts a measurable unit as the first parameter (does not accept relative units).

1. Finished Vanilla JS Carousel project
2. Looked into grid autofit and autofill properties (a possible way to avoid some media queries)
3. Learned more about minxmax, min/max-content, how and when to use them
4. Made a small project playing with grid properties
5. Did the markup for the B&B website
