## Done

Made a bunch of progress with CSS: Javascript is next.
I want to improve my existing knowledge and get to know the ins and outs of this awesome programming language.
I am gonig to be cover some more advanced computer science topics that will make me understand how it works at a deeper level.

This includes:

    - Consolidate my React skills, learn about more advanced features and get to know what's happening under the hood
    - Learn more about Redux and other useful libraries
    - Practice algorithms
    - Go over the Js tutorial on w3s and explore more of its related content
    - Get to know how browsers work
    - Get my freecodecamp certificate
    - Start challenges on the huge lists of website i have in bookmarks 
    - Lots of other stuff i can't really think about right now 

I also want to work regurarly on my amazon scraper and start working on some other big projecs ideas i got recently (no spoiler)

I will still go back to "design" concepts because there are some things i am still missing of course, but i will dedicate less time than i used to do.

In particular:
    - Learn Saas
    - Get into Bootstrap, Foundation and other CSS libraries 
    - Go over these sections tutorials on w3s
    - Learn more about responsive design and best practices
    - Go over how to make more advanced animations

1. Took a course about ML on Udemy so i can make progress with my scraper
2. Started exploring datasets and ways to interpret different types of data
3. Took a React course on Udemy, finished the first section covering the basics and successfully pass the first test
4. Learned how to use state in dumb component using hooks
5. Understood the different methods of passing methods to child components in React, when and why to use arrow function to avoid unexpected "this" behaviour
6. Reviewed spreads and deconstructuring js features
7. Reviewed once again it is important to not modify state directly but always create a new copy to prevent unpredicted behaviour
